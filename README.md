What is Flutter?

Flutter is a fast-development framework SDK or software development kit made it by Google. It allows you to easily start builing native Android and iOS, along as desktop and web apps just with one framework, and one language. 

## The language, Dart

**Dart** is made it by Google as well as Flutter. It's a client-optimized programming language for apps on multiple platforms and is used to build mobile, desktop, server, and web applications. Dart is an object-oriented, class-based, garbage-collected language with C-style syntax  so it's seem like the ideal scenario to replace old and ugly Java SDK's, along as Android, which will be replaced by Fuchsia, the new mobile OS by Google, with a really versatile language like Dart.
